# data-core

In construction. We want to make available a set of tools we have been using at UChicago to move data between stata, python, R and matlab. 

The end goal is to faciliate replication and code reuse for data with specific structure (panel, matched employer employee data, etc...). Often the code for papers is written in a specific language and requires a specific format (some specific column name is a simple example). This package aims at facilitating this by offering a common structure for common data formats so that each code/package can be applied in a way which is relatively straightforward.

More soon!
